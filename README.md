# AI-Based-Car-Diagnosis-App
create an innovative application that utilizes artificial intelligence to diagnose car issues by analyzing images and relevant data. The app should feature a user-friendly interface, robust image processing capabilities, and accurate diagnostic outputs. The ideal candidate will have experience in AI, machine learning, and mobile app development.
--------------------------------------
To create an innovative AI-driven application for diagnosing car issues through image analysis and relevant data, we will break down the steps into two major components: the Machine Learning Model for diagnosing car issues, and the Mobile Application (frontend) that will interact with the backend and display the results to users.
Step 1: Machine Learning Model (AI)

We'll start by creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze car images (such as engine parts, tires, etc.) and predict potential issues. For simplicity, the code below assumes you have a dataset of labeled car images.
Python Code for Model Training and Image Processing

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np
import cv2
import os
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Loading and preprocessing the dataset
def load_data(image_dir, img_size=(128, 128)):
    images = []
    labels = []
    
    # Assuming directory structure:
    # image_dir/class1/image1.jpg, image_dir/class1/image2.jpg, ...
    # image_dir/class2/image1.jpg, image_dir/class2/image2.jpg, ...
    for label in os.listdir(image_dir):
        label_folder = os.path.join(image_dir, label)
        if os.path.isdir(label_folder):
            for img_name in os.listdir(label_folder):
                img_path = os.path.join(label_folder, img_name)
                img = cv2.imread(img_path)
                img = cv2.resize(img, img_size)
                img = img / 255.0  # Normalize image
                images.append(img)
                labels.append(int(label))  # Assuming folder names are the labels
    
    images = np.array(images)
    labels = np.array(labels)
    return images, labels

# Load data
image_dir = 'path_to_your_dataset'  # path to your dataset
X, y = load_data(image_dir)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build CNN model
def build_cnn_model(input_shape=(128, 128, 3)):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(len(np.unique(y)), activation='softmax')  # Output layer for multi-class classification
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Train the model
model = build_cnn_model()
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Save the trained model
model.save('car_issue_diagnosis_model.h5')

This code trains a CNN model using images of car issues. After training, the model can predict if a given image shows a car with an issue or not. You will need a labeled dataset where each image is classified into different types of issues or a "no issue" category.
Step 2: Backend API

We need a backend API to serve the trained model and handle image uploads. We'll use Flask to create a simple API that accepts image uploads, processes them using the trained model, and returns the diagnosis.
Python Code for Flask API

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import cv2

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the pre-trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('car_issue_diagnosis_model.h5')

# Function to preprocess the image
def preprocess_image(image):
    img = cv2.imread(image)
    img = cv2.resize(img, (128, 128))  # Resize to the input size expected by the model
    img = img / 255.0  # Normalize image
    return np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension

# Define the API endpoint for diagnosis
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No file part'}), 400
    
    file = request.files['file']
    file_path = 'uploaded_image.jpg'
    file.save(file_path)  # Save the image temporarily
    
    # Preprocess image and make prediction
    img = preprocess_image(file_path)
    prediction = model.predict(img)
    diagnosis = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]  # Get the predicted class
    
    # Map diagnosis label back to a human-readable name
    diagnosis_labels = ['No Issues', 'Engine Issues', 'Tire Issues', 'Brake Issues']
    result = diagnosis_labels[diagnosis]  # Adjust this based on your actual labels
    
    return jsonify({'diagnosis': result})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

This Flask API accepts POST requests with image files, processes the image, and predicts the car issue based on the trained model. The result is returned as a JSON object.
Step 3: Frontend - Mobile Application

Now, you need to create a mobile application that can send images to the Flask API for diagnosis. The app should have a camera feature to capture images and display the results.
Flutter Code for Mobile App Frontend

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';

class CarDiagnosisApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CarDiagnosisAppState createState() => _CarDiagnosisAppState();
}

class _CarDiagnosisAppState extends State<CarDiagnosisApp> {
  File? _image;
  String diagnosis = '';

  // Function to pick an image from camera
  Future<void> pickImage() async {
    final picker = ImagePicker();
    final pickedFile = await picker.getImage(source: ImageSource.camera);
    setState(() {
      _image = File(pickedFile!.path);
    });
  }

  // Function to send the image to the Flask API and get diagnosis
  Future<void> getDiagnosis() async {
    if (_image == null) return;

    var uri = Uri.parse('http://your_backend_url/predict');
    var request = http.MultipartRequest('POST', uri);
    request.files.add(await http.MultipartFile.fromPath('file', _image!.path));
    
    var response = await request.send();
    var responseData = await response.stream.bytesToString();
    
    var decodedData = jsonDecode(responseData);
    setState(() {
      diagnosis = decodedData['diagnosis'];
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Car Issue Diagnosis")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            _image == null
                ? Text('No image selected.')
                : Image.file(_image!),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: pickImage,
              child: Text('Take Picture'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: getDiagnosis,
              child: Text('Diagnose'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Diagnosis: $diagnosis'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: CarDiagnosisApp(),
  ));
}

This Flutter application allows users to take a picture of their car using their phoneâ€™s camera. It then sends the image to the backend API for diagnosis, and displays the result on the screen.
Step 4: Deployment

    Backend API Deployment:
        You can deploy the Flask app to Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud to make it publicly accessible.
        Ensure the API is running and accessible to the mobile app.

    Mobile App Deployment:
        The mobile app can be deployed to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store for user download.

Conclusion

This solution outlines the development of an AI-powered mobile application for diagnosing car issues based on images. It integrates machine learning (CNNs) for image processing, a Flask backend API to serve the model, and a mobile application (built with Flutter) for the user interface. Once deployed, this system will allow users to diagnose car issues quickly by simply uploading an image from their mobile device.
